title: OMG EPIC POGGIES WEBSITE
---

One day, my tech teacher asked me to make a website. Here it is. Yay

This website will probably be used for different kinds of work, and may look different as time goes on. Currently, it's uh, kinda blank, but more stuff is going to be put in later.

I am currently working on adding more content that is useful to this page, and currently it's in the most bare state. This will change.

## What's included

Poole is a streamlined Jekyll site designed and built as a foundation for building more meaningful themes. Poole, and every theme built on it like this one, includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404]({{ '404.html' | relative_url }}), [RSS feed]({{ 'atom.xml' | relative_url }}), posts, [archive page]({{ 'archive' | relative_url }}), and [example page]({{ 'about' | relative_url }}))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Jekyll's built-in support for Rouge

Additional features are available in individual themes.

## Browser support

Poole and its themes are by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), Firefox, and Edge.

## Download

These themes are developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the [GitHub repository]({{ site.github.repo }}) for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
